                <h2>Early Years</h2>
                <p>
                    I was born to Peleus, a mortal king, and Thetis, a sea nymph. From the moment I came into this world, my mother sought to make me invulnerable. She dipped me in the River Styx, which made my body impervious to harm—except for my heel, where she held me. As a child, I was raised by Chiron, the wise centaur. He taught me many things—medicine, music, hunting—but above all, he helped me hone the skills that would make me a formidable warrior. I was strong, fast, and skilled, even from a young age. There was a prophecy that I would either live a long and quiet life, or a short, glorious one. If I chose to fight in the Trojan War, I would die young, but my name would live on forever. My mother, fearing my fate, tried to hide me away. She disguised me as a girl and sent me to the court of King Lycomedes, where I lived under the name Pyrrha, hoping to keep me safe from the war.

                <h2>Adult Years</h2>
                <p>
                    But fate found me. Eventually, I was discovered, and I was called upon to join the Greeks in the Trojan War. Despite my mothers efforts to protect me, I chose to fight. I became the greatest warrior on the Greek side, unmatched in battle. Yet, my pride and temper often got the best of me. When Agamemnon, the Greek leader, took my prize, Briseis, I withdrew from the war in anger, refusing to fight for the Greeks. Without me, they struggled, and many lives were lost. During this time, my closest friend, Patroclus, put on my armor to lead the Greek forces in my stead. But he was killed by Hector, the greatest of the Trojan warriors. His death shattered me. The pain of losing him drove me back to the battlefield with a fury I could not control.

                <h2>The Tragedy</h2>
                <p>
                    I killed Hector in single combat, avenging Patroclus, and dragged his body behind my chariot as I mourned and raged. But despite my strength and victories, I could not escape my fate. My one weakness—my heel—was my undoing. Paris, Hectors brother, with the help of the god Apollo, shot an arrow into my heel, and that was how I met my end. My story, a tale of glory and tragedy, is a reminder that even the mightiest are not immune to mortality. My pride, my wrath, my friendship—these defined me, but they also led to my downfall.

A thousand years before the time of Christ, Trojan prince Paris (Orlando Bloom) abducts the legendary Greek beauty Helen, queen of Sparta (Diane Kruger), starting a war led by heroes Achilles (Pitt) and Hector (Eric Bana) that devastates the ancient world.
